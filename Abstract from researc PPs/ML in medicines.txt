Machine Learning (ML) provides methods, techniques, and tools that can 
help solving diagnostic and prognostic problems in a variety of medical domains. 
ML is being used for the analysis of the importance of clinical parameters and 
their combinations for prognosis, e.g. prediction of disease progression, 
extraction of medical knowledge for outcome research, therapy planning 
and support, and for the overall patient management. ML is also being 
used for data analysis, such as detection of regularities in the data by
appropriately dealing with imperfect data, interpretation of continuous 
data used in the Intensive Care Unit, and intelligent alarming resulting 
in effective and efficient monitoring. It is argued that the successful 
implementation of ML methods can help the integration of computer-based systems 
in the healthcare environment providing opportunities to facilitate and 
enhance the work of medical experts and ultimately to improve the 
efficiency and quality of medical care. Below, we summarize some 
major ML applications in medicine.
